## Why?
* Instead of viewing a bulky google sheet, now you view your expenses/income in a mobile-friendly interface
* User-friendly and smart filtering tools let you filter expenses on the go!
* Comparison metrics can be set up to compare expenses/income to a previous period as well.

## Where do I start?
Google Data Studio has a really neat integration with Google Sheets. In this project, I use (exploit?) Google Data Studio as my mobile-friendly front-end for my Budget tracking mechanism that I described in my other repo - https://github.com/sammitjain/budget-tracker/

## Okay, how do I set this up?
If you already have a running expense system like the one I set up above, this will be fairly straight-forward.
* Open this template report - [Sammit's Budget Template](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/5fd60abd-74ad-461d-a8d0-5ef7fb16685f)
  * Note: You may need to login to your Google Account for accessing Data Studio. It's free to use for our relatively simple requirements.
* Create a copy by clicking on the "Make a Copy" option on the right menu
* In your copy, you will need to configure your "Data sources" by selecting your own budget sheets. 

Note: It may take some tweaking to set up the sheet well for your purpose. Make sure you have your dates configured properly for Data Studio to pick it up. (It follows 9/26/2009 format for dates)
